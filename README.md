# Mad-Birds-Game
This is my take on the famous Angry Birds Game with one difference.
I always used to get fascinated by the artistically pleasing yet complex levels i used to get while playing that famous Angry birds game on my old iphone and i always wondered, woldn't it be great if we could create our own levels? And that is what my game aims at, this game tries to does stuff which the original game didn't. With this game you can create your own levels and play along, it's as simple as drag and drop, i have provided two sample levels and also included all the necessary assets that you might need to create your own levels, the only talent you need is creativity. This game can also run on your browser using webgl support so you have something else to play along apart form that now dated dinosaur game when you run out of your luck with the internet.

### Please note
You need Unity3D to run this at first and to create your own levels, after that you can export the game to any platform of yoyr choice. Please email me at somughosh74@gmail.com to get a step-by-step instruction on how to add levels or you can contact me at +91-9176210041.
